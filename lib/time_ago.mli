(** Time-ago turns elapsed or future times into read-friendly time strings meant
    to be used in user interfaces where precision is not a major concern. The chart
    below shows the relationship between the magnitude of the timespan and the
    string generated.

(** Constructs a read-friendly time string using [Time_ns.t] as the reference time. [?now]
    defaults to [Time_ns.now ()]. Now > reference denotes an event in the past, while
    now < reference denotes an event in the future.
